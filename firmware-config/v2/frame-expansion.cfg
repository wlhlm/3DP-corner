[frame_expansion_compensation]
# The temperature coefficient of expansion, in mm/K. For example, a
# temp_coeff of 0.01 mm/K will move the Z axis downwards by 0.01 mm for every
# Kelvin/degree celcius that the frame temperature increases. Defaults to 0.0,
# no offset.
temp_coeff: 0.0086
# Disables compensation above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
# will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z position
# again. The default is 0.0mm (always on).
#max_comp_z:
# Maximum absolute compensation that can be applied to the Z axis [mm]. The
# default is 99999999.0mm (unlimited).
#max_z_offset:
temp_sensor: temperature_sensor frame
# The Z stepper motor linked with the Z endstop, as written in printer.cfg.
# Used for triggering reference temperature measurement. Usually 'stepper_z'
# unless otherwise defined.
z_stepper: stepper_z

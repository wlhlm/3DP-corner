[server]
#  The host address in which to bind the HTTP server.
host: 127.0.0.1
#   The port the HTTP server will listen on.
port: 7125
#   The address of Unix Domain Socket used to communicate with Klipper.
klippy_uds_address: /run/klipper/ud_sock
#   The maximum size allowed for a file upload.
max_upload_size: 700

[file_manager]
#   By default Moonraker will validate that Klipper's configuration file exists
#   within the data path's "config" folder, as this is a requirement for
#   Moonraker to write to the configuration.  If this validation check fails
#   Moonaker will warn the user. Installations that do not wish to use Moonraker
#   to manage Klipper's configuration may set this option to False to bypass the
#   location check.  The default is True.
check_klipper_config_path: False
#   When set to True the file manager will add uploads to the job_queue when
#   the `start_print` flag has been set.  The default if False.
queue_gcode_uploads: False
#   When set to True gcode files will be run through a "preprocessor"
#   during metdata extraction if object tags are detected.  This preprocessor
#   replaces object tags with G-Code commands compatible with Klipper's
#   "cancel object" functionality.  Note that this process is file I/O
enable_object_processing: False

[machine]
#   The provider implementation used to collect system service information
#   and run service actions (ie: start, restart, stop).  This can be "none",
#   "systemd_dbus", or "systemd_cli".  If the provider is set to "none" service
#   action APIs will be disabled.  The default is systemd_dbus.
provider: systemd_dbus
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's systemd service unit.  If Moonraker
#   detects that a change is necessary it will attempt to do so.  Custom
#   installations and installations that do systemd should set this to False.
#   The default is True.
validate_service: False
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's configuration.  If Moonraker detects
#   deprecated options it will attempt to correct them.  The default is True.
validate_config: False

[database]

[data_store]
#   The maximum number of temperature values to store for each sensor. Note
#   that this value also applies to the "target", "power", and "fan_speed"
#   if the sensor reports them.  The default is 1200, which is enough to
#   store approximately 20 minutes of data at one value per second.
temperature_store_size: 1500
#   The maximum number "gcode lines" to store.
gcode_store_size:  2000

[job_queue]
#   When set to true the job queue will attempt to load the next
#   pending job when Klipper reports as "Ready".  If the queue has
#   been paused it will automatically resume.  Note that neither
#   the job_transition_delay nor the job_transition_gcode are
#   applied in this case.  The default is False.
load_on_startup: False
#   When set to True the queue will automatically transition to
#   the next job in the queue after the current job is complete.
#   This is useful for belt printers and other machines with the
#   ability to automate clearing of the build area.  When False
#   the queue will be paused after each job is loaded, requiring
#   that users manually resume to load the next print.  The default
#   is False.
automatic_transition: False

[history]

[authorization]
#   When set to True a user login is required for authorization if at least
#   one user has been created, overriding the "trusted_clients" configuration.
#   If no users have been created then trusted client checks will apply.
#   The default is False.
force_logins: True
#   A list of newline separated ip addresses and/or ip ranges that are
#   trusted. Trusted clients are given full access to the API.  Both IPv4
#   and IPv6 addresses and ranges are supported. Ranges must be expressed
#   in CIDR notation (see http://ip.sb/cidr for more info).  For example, an
#   entry of 192.168.1.0/24 will authorize IPs in the range of 192.168.1.1 -
#   192.168.1.254.  Note that when specifying IPv4 ranges the last segment
#   of the ip address must be 0. The default is no clients or ranges are
#   trusted.
trusted_clients:
  192.168.0.0/16
  172.16.0.0/12
